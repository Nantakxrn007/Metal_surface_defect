If the model isn't trained on augmentation, it's almost impossible to predict augmentation.
If the pre-trained model is trained with FC, it's significantly better and faster than initially model like CNN.
If the acc isn't good, we should initially tune the learning rate.
If the dataloader val test is not random, it shouldn't be compared.
The dataloader __len__ and __getitem__ are very important. Initially, we'll use __len__ to execute the idx and forloop following __getitem__.
